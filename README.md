# 3.Dark
Scratch 3.0 Dark Theme Userscript (and general theme framework)

Some work is still needed, but it is pretty much done.

# Install
I use the Tampermonkey extension for userscripts. Get it at <https://tampermonkey.net/>.
Install userscript from here: <https://github.com/infinitytec/3.Dark/raw/master/3dark.user.js>

# Make your own theme
I included notes so you should be able to find your way around.
Note that this falls under the MIT License, which I found appropriate.
